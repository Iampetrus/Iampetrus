Hi, I’m @Iampetrus, a pro from the advertising industry with a background in Philosophy.
I’m interested in layouts and design after quite a few professional experiences in editorial departments with digital contents for magazines.
I’m currently learning what it takes to become a Front End Engineer with some knowledge of UX and etnography.
I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can support, aiming to team up and keep learning.
You can reach me here
